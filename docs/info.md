## How it works

This project utilizes full adders to create a 4x4 array multiplier. It takes an input of 2 4bit signals and full adds the individual bits to create partial products, which are then full added together to create a final product. Its output is a single 8bit signal which represents the product of the two input signals.

## How to test

Cd into the test folder and edit the test cases that represent the numbers to be multiplied, then confirm the module outputs the same result as the expected product.
